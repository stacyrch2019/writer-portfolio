# Display captions in Chrome

This article will show you how to display the Live Caption feature in the Chrome browser. Once the captions display, you can use them to view any video or listen to any audio content in Chrome. 

## Accessibility

The Internet has allowed life to become more accessible for people with hearing loss in recent years. The days of YouTube getting captions hilariously wrong are (almost) over. It's now possible to stream content and get captions for nearly every video you watch or podcast you want to listen to, as long as you watch or listen on your Chrome browser.

## Live captions

As of January 2023, Google remains the only tech company to provide a free caption feature outside of specific video content. Also, while many podcasts provide transcripts, those transcripts usually arrive after the original airing, leaving people with hearing loss behind the curve. Now, the Deaf and hard of hearing (HoH) can enjoy more content as soon as its released. 

## How to get the Live Caption feature

1. Open the Chrome browser. 
1. In the upper right-hand corner, click the three dots.
