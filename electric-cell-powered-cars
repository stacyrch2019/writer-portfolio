# Electric and cell-powered cars

This article gives a condensed history of EVs through 2012.

## What is an electric car?

An electric car is what the name implies: a car powered strictly by electricity. The engine of a fully electric car is not gas powered; it is electric with a battery for electricity storage. Fully electric vehicles are not widely used yet.

Battery technology in electric cars cannot provide the same amount of energy that a tank of gas can. Electric cars can drive 100–200 miles before needing recharged, whereas a gas-powered vehicle can drive about 300 miles. Plus, EVs take a long time to recharge, needing need 4–8 hours to fully charge. 

However, their potential to reduce greenhouse gases is nothing short of phenomenal. They emit zero gases. Plus, the electric engine requires less maintenance than the gas-powered engine. Keeping EVs charged costs much less than keeping a gas-powered car’s tank full.

## History of the Electric Car

At the turn of the 20th century, the electric car was popular. At that time, cars were used only for short jaunts around town—a task for which the EV was well suited. The technology was no slouch, either; the 1914 Detroit Electric (driven—ironically—by Henry Ford’s wife, Clara) could last 80 miles without a charge.

But when ownership became more popular in the 1920s, the gas-powered car began to overtake the EV.
Automakers didn’t produce the EV again until the 1960s, when rising fuel prices and conservation concerns became factors.

Since then, EVs have been produced only in small quantities, and only in fits and starts. General Motors
produced the EV1; Toyota produced the Rav4 EV—but neither made it to mass production. With each attempt, the auto industry produces a better EV, but the battery technology needs more refinement in order for the electric car to provide the same long-distance convenience consumers get with gas-powered cars.

## What is a fuel cell-powered car?

A fuel cell powered-car does not require plugging in. Storing the hydrogen in a tank, the car flows hydrogen and oxygen from the air through opposite sides of the cell, where they’re converted into an electric charge. The motor uses this to power the car.

There’s tremendous potential in fuel cell technology. Hydrogen is widely available. The technology is
completely clean. Furthermore, hydrogen has more energy than gasoline. A liter of hydrogen would last much longer than a liter of gas.

However, its drawbacks are considerable. Hydrogen takes up more room than gasoline, so storage tanks
would need to be much bigger than is practical. A new system of hydrogen stations would require billions of dollars and the cooperation of government and businesses to work together. It may be a while before consumers see this technology become a reality.

## History of the Fuel Cell-Powered Car

Fuel-cell technology dates back to 1839, when Sir William Grove discovered a way to generate electricity
through the reverse electrolysis of water. By 1959, the technology was sophisticated enough to use in a tractor. NASA also developed fuel cell technology in the late 1950s. It now uses the technology in its space program to supply electricity to space missions. The technology is expected to replace more conventional fuel sources in the future—and not just in cars.

## Alternative Fuel and Technology for Cars

There are several fuels and technologies being developed in the auto industry to mitigate the emissions of the gas-powered car. Some alternative fuels are already blended with gasoline to reduce pollution.

Ethanol is made from corn and other crops. It produces less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuels. Currently ethanol is in relatively wide use, from blends that use anywhere from 10% ethanol (known as “E10”) to 85% ethanol (“E85”).

Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oil and animal fats. It can be produced domestically and is renewable. It also produces less air pollution than conventional diesel—with which it is mixed to help reduce emissions.

Natural gas, like oil, is a fossil fuel, but it generates less greenhouse gases. Recent estimates of supply
predict that natural gas will be a bigger part of our future energy consumption.

Propane is also a fossil fuel, but it’s clean burning. Produced from domestic sources, propane is usually less expensive than gasoline and can be used to fuel gas-powered engines.

Hydrogen can be produced domestically and is renewable. Vehicles powered by hydrogen emit no harmful air pollutants. For these reasons, hydrogen has the most potential to take over gasoline as a fuel source. Other technologies, such as the electric car (EV) and the fuel cell-power car, are being perfected for consumer use. Most vehicles employing EV technology are hybrids. These are powered by gasoline engines, but also contain powerful batteries that sharply increase their gas mileage. A recent development, the plug-in hybrid, uses the gasoline engine to recharge the battery.
